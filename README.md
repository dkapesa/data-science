Executive Summary

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of renewable energy consumption trends in the United States from January 1973 to December 2024. Utilising data sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the study examines monthly consumption figures across various renewable energy sources—such as hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass—and sectors, including residential, commercial, transportation, electric power, and industrial.
The primary objective is to identify significant trends, correlations, and factors influencing the evolution of renewable energy consumption over the specified period. By employing Python for data analysis, the project encompasses data acquisition, pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation. The end goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations that can inform policy decisions, investment strategies, and further research in the renewable energy sector.

Key Questions Addressed:

1.	What are the overarching trends in renewable energy consumption in the U.S. from 1973 to 2024?
2.	How has the consumption of individual renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydroelectric) evolved over time?
3.	Which sectors have demonstrated the most significant shifts towards renewable energy utilisation?
4.	What correlations exist between renewable energy consumption and external factors such as policy changes, economic indicators, or technological advancements?
5.	How do seasonal variations impact renewable energy consumption across different sources and sectors?
6.	What projections can be made for future renewable energy consumption based on historical and identified trends?

By addressing these questions, the project aims to elucidate the dynamics of renewable energy consumption in the U.S., offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the energy sector.
